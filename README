This repository contains 2 python applications, mainly made for the fluxbox desktop (but will also work on other linux desktops.

- Fluxweather.py: A very simple system tray app that displays a weather icon, a tooltip with temperature and previsions, and can also display a satellite map.

- Fluxtwitter.py: A simple system tray app that retrieves and displays your twitter (and in the future facebook) timeline.

Both apps are under GPL license, feel free to use in any way you like!
